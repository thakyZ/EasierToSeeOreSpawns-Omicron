# Easier To See Ore Spawns
**This mod aims to help the colorblind or the visually impaired find ores on planets.**

The issue with how Space Engineers generates the coloring of ore on the planet's surface is not very good when trying to make it look different among the rest of the colors. The way Space Engineers generates the coloring is by manipulating the saturation of the ground texture, and since most color blind people can only see a grey variant of specific colors it doesn't help that grey on grey is at all good, so I went with the most saturated color I could choose, and it seems to work fairly well. There is issue on earth grass and alien green grass and alien orange grass where it seems to be the hardest to see, but I cannot change this as it would again make everything else harder to see.

If you have any issues or any critiques just drop a comment.
